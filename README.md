# my-pdf-to-csv
## A small and simple utility written in Batch and Python to automate my repetitive tasks for pdf and excel work.
I created this project to automate the creation of Excel spreadsheets based on data from PDF documents. The project is written in Batch and Python and I used the command tools from Xpdf as a pdf parser. 

Here is what this utility can do:
* Extract text from .pdf files and write them to .txt files
* Recognise phone numbers in .txt files (Ru format only)
* Recognise names of people in .txt files
* Recognise emails in .txt files
* Extract information from .txt files and write them to .csv files

Here are the simplest instructions for working with this utility.

1. Clone or download this project

3. Run "my_pdf_to_csv.bat"
4. Go to the "csv_files" folder
5. Open "extracted_data.csv"
